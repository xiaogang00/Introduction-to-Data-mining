This is the project which I taken in the third year of my college life.

* The introduction of this course is following:

  **This course is focused on introducing students the fundamental concepts, theory, and algorithms on data mining. Specifically, the syllabus includes the fundamental concepts of data mining, data preprocessing, association rule mining, clustering analysis, classifications, multimedia data mining, and relational data mining.**

* This file contain the project which is mainly about the **Recommendation system**

* The request for this project can be found in the website of 

  http://10.13.71.118/index.php/postgraduate-2/homework/

* The file of **data** contain the train data offered.

* The file of **code** contain the python code which I written to implement this project.

* The method I used to complete this project is following:

  * Collaborative Filter
  * SVD
  * KNN
